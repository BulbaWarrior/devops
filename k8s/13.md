Now we know that liveness and readiness probes happen every 10 seconds by default.
Most of the accesses are liveness probe from kubernetes itself since I check liveness by accessing /, but user access logs would be different for each pod
because users are forwarded to different pods by the service.

The ordering guarantee is unnecessary in our case because each pod is completely independent from the others
